# Todo-App


A simple Todo List app made with HTML, Bootstrap, Font-Awesome and VanillaJs (JavaScript)

 In the near future, I would like to:

1. Add a timing mechanism which would let the user add a time frame for the task
 
2. Also notify the user with an alert/sound when time for a task approaches or expires
 
How to use?

Hit the "Clone or Download" button, Unzip the downloaded file and hit the index.html file.
